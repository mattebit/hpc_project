## ✨ Key Features

- **Hybrid Parallelism:** Uses MPI for inter-node communication and OpenMP for intra-node threading.
- **Vectorized Compute:** SIMD-friendly loops utilizing AVX2/AVX-512 instructions.
- **Zero-Copy I/O:** Memory-mapped file reading (`mmap`) for instant graph loading.
- **Automated Tooling:** Complete suite for graph generation, benchmarking, and result plotting.

## 🛠 Architecture & Optimizations

This project moves beyond standard implementations by addressing hardware-level bottlenecks:

### 1. Memory Layout
* **Flattened 1D Arrays:** Replaced `uint16_t**` with `uint16_t*` aligned to 64-byte boundaries. This enables hardware prefetching and eliminates pointer-chasing overhead.
* **Branchless Logic:** Uses a symmetric $N \times N$ matrix to remove `if (row < col)` branching inside hot loops, preventing pipeline flushes.

### 2. Computation
* **SIMD Vectorization:** Inner loops are refactored to be autovectorizable, processing 16-32 edge weights per CPU cycle.
* **Logical Edge Pruning:** Edges connecting vertices within the same component are marked as `MAX_VALUE` to skip expensive union-find lookups in subsequent iterations.
* **Static Scheduling:** OpenMP `schedule(static)` is used to eliminate dynamic scheduling lock contention.

### 3. Communication
* **Bulk Broadcasting:** Replaced row-by-row broadcasting with a single bulk `MPI_Bcast`, saturating the interconnect bandwidth.
* **Tree Flattening:** Explicit path compression before parallel regions ensures $O(1)$ component lookups.

## ⚙️ Build & Run

### Prerequisites

* GCC (with OpenMP support)
* MPICH or OpenMPI

### 1. Compile

```bash
# Compiles optimized, baseline, and serial versions
make compile

```

*Compiler Flags Used:* `-O3 -fopenmp -march=native -ftree-vectorize -funroll-loops`

### 2. Generate Data

```bash
# Usage: ./graph_generator.sh <num_nodes> <filename>
./graph_generator.sh 20000 graph.txt

```

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
# Usage: mpirun -np <procs> src/new_main.o <nodes> <graph_file>
mpirun -np 4 src/new_main.o 20000 graph.txt

```

## ☁️ Cluster Deployment

Designed for PBS/Torque clusters (e.g., typically found in HPC environments).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make submit` | Submit the job defined in `scripts/submit_job.pbs` |
| `make monitor` | Check queue status (`qstat`) |
| `make watch-output` | Live tail of the output log |
| `make cancel` | Cancel all user jobs |

**Configuration (`submit_job.pbs`):**

```bash
#PBS -l select=2:ncpus=8:mem=4gb
#PBS -l walltime=00:10:00
#PBS -q short_cpuQ

```

## 📊 Analysis & Benchmarking

The project includes scripts to compare Strong and Weak scaling.

**Run Comparison:**

```bash
./scripts/compare_mpi_implementations.sh

```

This script executes both `main.o` and `new_main.o` against the same dataset and reports:

1. Computation Time (CPU time excluding setup)
2. Total Wall Time (End-to-end execution)
3. Total MST Weight (Verification)

## 🛣 Future Roadmap

* [ ] **Sparse Matrix Support:** Switch to CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format to support N > 100,000 graphs.
* [ ] **Asynchronous MPI:** Implement `MPI_Iallreduce` to overlap communication with computation.
* [ ] **Hierarchical Merging:** Implement a divide-and-conquer strategy for massive scale (>1M nodes).
* [ ] **GPU Offloading:** Port local edge scanning to CUDA/OpenACC.
